/*
This linter consists of analyzers implementing golang.org/x/tools/go/analysis,
analyzers of staticcheck liner and three custom analyzers.

# Staticlint usage

This command vets all the packages in the current directory:

	staticlint ./...

# Staticlint config

Use config.json to use needed analyzers. Example:

	{
		"analysispasses": [
			"appends",
			"asmdecl"
		],
		"staticcheck": [
			"SA1000",
			"SA1001"
		],
		"custom": [
			"exitos",
			"errwrap",
			"noctx"
		]
	}

	SA1007	Invalid URL in net/url.Parse
	SA1008	Non-canonical key in http.Header map
	SA1010	(*regexp.Regexp).FindAll called with n == 0, which will always return zero results
	SA1011	Various methods in the strings package expect valid UTF-8, but invalid input is provided
	SA1012	A nil context.Context is being passed to a function, consider using context.TODO instead
	SA1013	io.Seeker.Seek is being called with the whence constant as the first argument, but it should be the second
	SA1014	Non-pointer value passed to Unmarshal or Decode
	SA1015	Using time.Tick in a way that will leak. Consider using time.NewTicker, and only use time.Tick in tests, commands and endless functions
	SA1016	Trapping a signal that cannot be trapped
	SA1017	Channels used with os/signal.Notify should be buffered
	SA1018	strings.Replace called with n == 0, which does nothing
	SA1019	Using a deprecated function, variable, constant or field
	SA1020	Using an invalid host:port pair with a net.Listen-related function
	SA1021	Using bytes.Equal to compare two net.IP
	SA1023	Modifying the buffer in an io.Writer implementation

	SA1028	sort.Slice can only be used on slices
	SA1029	Inappropriate key in call to context.WithValue
	SA1030	Invalid argument in call to a strconv function
	SA2000	sync.WaitGroup.Add called inside the goroutine, leading to a race condition
	SA2001	Empty critical section, did you mean to defer the unlock?
	SA2002	Called testing.T.FailNow or SkipNow in a goroutine, which isn’t allowed
	SA2003	Deferred Lock right after locking, likely meant to defer Unlock instead
	SA3000	TestMain doesn’t call os.Exit, hiding test failures
	SA3001	Assigning to b.N in benchmarks distorts the results

	SA4003	Comparing unsigned values against negative values is pointless
	SA4004	The loop exits unconditionally after one iteration
	SA4005	Field assignment that will never be observed. Did you mean to use a pointer receiver?
	SA4006	A value assigned to a variable is never read before being overwritten. Forgotten error check or dead code?
	SA4008	The variable in the loop condition never changes, are you incrementing the wrong variable?
	SA4009	A function argument is overwritten before its first use

	SA4012	Comparing a value against NaN even though no value is equal to NaN
	SA4013	Negating a boolean twice (!!b) is the same as writing b. This is either redundant, or a typo.

	SA4015	Calling functions like math.Ceil on floats converted from integers doesn’t do anything useful
	SA4016	Certain bitwise operations, such as x ^ 0, do not do anything useful
	SA4017	Discarding the return values of a function without side effects, making the call pointless
	SA4018	Self-assignment of variables
	SA4019	Multiple, identical build constraints in the same file
	SA4020	Unreachable case clause in a type switch

	SA9001	Defers in range loops may not run when you expect them to
